# KirillChugunovRepo

--

My name is Kirill Chugunov, I'm 23 years old and currently work for a real estate investment firm Sila Capital as a data analyst.

I want to make fintech a part of my career and become a quant trader.

Finance in a way rules the world and I'd like to be a part of it, as well as use modern tech to shape the world
