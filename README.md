# SoFi Technologies, Inc.
### NASDAQ : SOFI
</br>
</br>

## Overview and Origin

* SoFi was founded in the summer of 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, four students who met at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

* The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. The company's loan program was a pilot at Stanford; for this pilot program, 40 alumni loaned about $2 million to approximately 100 students, for an average of $20,000 per student.

* In May 2012 SoFi becomes the first company to introduce refinancing of federal and private student loans.

* In September 2012, SoFi raised $77.2 million from Baseline Ventures along with several other private investors.


## Business Activities:

* SoFi wealth was launched in 2017, to help young families and couples to prepare for retirement, or life events like buying a first home.

* The intedned customer of SoFi is millenials and young families, which comprise over 55% of their customer base.
There are over 80 million people in the US alone who fit this group, giving company plenty of room for growth.

* What makes SoFi appealing is their relations with customers: zero-commission trading, financial planning, 1 on 1 customer support, and career services.
All of these exlusive perks are accessible to customers at no cost, while traditional institutions would charge hefty fees. 

* SoFi has a massive technical stack, the coding languages go from Python to Swift. While for the devops they use GitLab, VS Code, Docker and many other tools.

* The engineers use both quantitative and qualitative information (i.e. what their members are doing in the app, what are they giving as feedback already, and what are some open needs they have) which helps them better understand the member and where the team should focus.

* For instanse, Senior Staff Engineer, Donald Cestnik has this to say about prioritizing certain security aspects, which were addressed because of the analysis above:
"_Accurately identifying fraud and providing risk scoring keeps our costs down and boosts trust._"


## Landscape:

* SoFi started out in the lending domain, but quickly expanded to other services, including Investment Management, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies, Capital Investment and Robo-Advising.

* Over the past years the lending industry quickly evolved, thanks to advances in Big Data and AI, which are now being used to determine creditworthiness of an individual or a company. 

* Banks typically turn to credit bureaus or company accounts to inform their decisions. This means they are constrained by a narrowly-defined data set that leaves them little room for manoeuvre. Fintechs, by contrast, base their decisions on a much wider set of parameters. A case in point is SoFi, which utilizes large datasets to make their decisions.

* In recent years a new model started emerging: Buy Now Pay Later, with Affirm, at 2.87B market cap, being the clear leader and innovator. Other competitors include companies like Klarna, LightStream and even PayPal.


## Results

* SoFi has been growing at a very impressive rate since it was founded. Thanks to smart business decisions and a robust model, built on customer trust, SoFi generated 521 million of assets under management as of 2021

* One of the most important KPIs for banks (which SoFi could be considered), net interest margin (NIM) reveals a bank's net profit on interest-earning assets, such as loans or investment securities.

* SoFI has a NIM of 6.5%, which is impressive, when compared to the industry average of 3.5%, although it is still very tiny in terms of assets under management. 

* However SoFi is still unprofitable, mainly due to the Silicon Valley's "Grow Now, Turn Profit Later" approach, which fell out of favor after the Fed started tightening it's monetary policy.  

* This lead to SoFi losing around 70% of it's stock value since the peak of 2021. The reported loss was $320.4 Million dollars in 2022.
