* The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. The company's loan program was a pilot at Stanford; for this pilot program, 40 alumni loaned about $2 million to approximately 100 students, for an average of $20,000 per student.

* In May 2012 SoFi becomes the first company to introduce refinancing of federal and private student loans.

* In September 2012, SoFi raised $77.2 million from Baseline Ventures along with several other private investors.

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
